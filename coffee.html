<H2>Ways I Like to Brew Coffee</h2>
<h3>Espresso</h3>
<p>My favourite coffee is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino">cappuccino</a>, with a little sugar, in a fairly small cup. Usually around 10-12 ounces. Compared to an espresso, this is fairly large. Compared to filter coffee, this is fairly small.</p>
<p>Usually I make this with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_machine">espresso machine</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Length">double shot</a> of espresso, topped with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art">foamed milk</a> and a little heart poured into the foam. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPyN-Hsb7g">A skill I recently taught myself</a>.</p>
<p>I weigh out 20 grams of beans, grind them in a <a href="http://www.oehandgrinders.com/LIDO-3-_c_30.html">hand powered grinder</a> and pour them into the <a href="https://betterespressomachinesreviews.com/heck-portafilter-portafilter-facts-explained/">portafilter</a>. I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Coffee-Distributor-Leveler-tool-Distribution/dp/B077BZ4CV6">distributor</a> to make sure they're evenly spread through the portafilter and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kC508VQUc7k">tamp them</a>.</p>
<p>If I'm away, on holiday I often use a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSppIjPSxyc">Minipresso</a> as a stand-in for my espresso machine, its almost as good, although it only brews a single shot. I use a small <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Milk-Frother-Electric-Powerful-Cappuccino/dp/B073D7CWHV">electric whisk</a> to make foamed milk.</p>
<h3>Aeropress</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.aeropress.co.uk/">Aeropress</a> is my second favourite way to make coffee, it's <a href="https://vimeo.com/40980282">fun</a>, versatile and makes a flawless brew <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONn2FX4Pss0">almost</a> every time. The coffee is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press">cafetiere</a> coffee, although with a much cleaner mouth feel as less grounds make it into the mug. The aeropress uses paper filters to keep the coffee in the device and not in your cup.</p>

<h3>Iced Coffee</h3>

<p><a href="https://marco.org/2012/07/30/iced-coffee-with-aeropress">Use an aeropress to make iced coffee</a>. <span class="tooltip">You won't regret it.<span class="tooltiptext">Unless you drink too much and then try to sleep. Then you'll regret it.<br/> All night.</span></span></p>

<h2>Beans</h2>

<p>Freshly roasted beans, ground as close to the time of brewing as possible are a must! The beans in supermarkets are often stale, bitter and roasted far too dark.</p>
<p>I buy mine online, the list below includes places I have tried and liked a lot:</p>
